<p>The plugin api v3 contains baked code (see avisynth.h from v2.58 and
older versions) which is code that is included inline. The result is all
 that code is "baked" into all and every plugin instead being called
from avisynth.dll. The problem with baked code is that it cannot be
changed without recompiling the plugin. (If it were just a declaration
only then the active code would be whatever is in the current
avisynth.dll.) This is a problem if the plugin api will be changed again
 in the future (and it probably will one day) and this issue is solved
in 2.6.
</p><p>Starting from 2.6 the version 2.5 plugins are supported directly
(with current baked code; meaning that plugins compiled for 2.5 can be
loaded when using 2.6) and all the baked code from 2.6+ plugins is
removed and the plugins are still source compatible. Note that the baked
 code is moved to interface.cpp, where also the structure AVS_Linkage is
 defined.
</p><p>AVS_Linkage is a mechanism to initialize the function table with
the entry points for an alternate server. Server here means something
that loads and executes an avisynth.h api plugin. This is normally
avisynth.dll but Avery Lee has expressed a desire to be able to load and
 execute avisynth plugins directly in VirtualDub. Much the same way
Avisynth can currently load VirtualDub plugins today.

<p>On the user plugin side the entry-point is now called
AvisynthPluginInit3 and it take 2 arguments, an IScriptEnvironment* and
an AVS_Linkage*. The user needs to declare static storage for
AVS_Linkage* AVS_linkage; and in their AvisynthPluginInit3 code save the
 supplied 2nd value to the AVS_linkage variable. The rest of the code
should be the same as for 2.5 plugins, i.e. env-&gt;AddFunction, etc.
</p><p>In avisynth.h the type AVS_Linkage structure is declared and
macros emit stub baked code that calls the appropriate code in the
server via the AVS_Linkage function pointers. The stub code checks to
make sure AVS_linkage is not Null and the offset of the function pointer
 is within the current size of the structure. If okay the function is
called otherwise it evaluates as 0. Within the Avisynth.dll project
these macros resolve to a simple ";" so no stub code is emitted just
declarations occur, this is triggered by the definition of the reserved
symbol AVISYNTH_CORE.
</p><p>In interface.cpp the real code is defined and the instance of the
 AVS_Linkage structure is declared and initialised. In plugins.cpp the
address of this is passed to the users AvisynthPluginInit3 code along
with the ScriptEnvironment address. A minor hurdle was that you may not
take the address of constructor or destructor routines in C++ so I to
move forward I just nested the appropriate code for these down one
method and used the address of the nested method. I unimaginatively
called these CONSTRUCTORn() and DESTRUCTOR() [edit: shouldn't this be
DESTRUCTORn()???].
</p><p>In your plugin source file the changes are trivial. Declare the
storage for AVS_linkage, rename the .dll entrypoint from
AvisynthPluginInit2 to AvisynthPluginInit3 and add the extra
AVS_Linkage* argument.
