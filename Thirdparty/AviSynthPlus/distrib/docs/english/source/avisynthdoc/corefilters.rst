Core Filters
============

Introduction
------------

The available (internal) filters are listed here and divided into categories.
A short description is added, including the supported color formats (and
sample types for the audio filters). There are some functions which combine
two or more clips in different ways. How the video content is calculated is
described for each function, but :doc:`here is a summary which explains which
properties that the resulting clip will have <filters_mult_input_clips>`.

.. _Media file filters:

Media file filters
------------------

These filters can be used to read or write media files. Usually they produce
source clips for processing. See debug filters for non-file source filters.

- :doc:`AVISource / OpenDMLSource / AVIFileSource <corefilters/avisource>` Opens an AVI file.
- :doc:`DirectShowSource <corefilters/directshowsource>` DirectShowSource reads filename using DirectShow
- :doc:`ImageReader / ImageSource / ImageSourceAnim <corefilters/imagesource>` These filters produce a video
  clip by reading in still images or an animated image.
- :doc:`Imagewriter <corefilters/imagewriter>` Writes frames as images to your hard disk.

  exports audio to several compressors).
- :doc:`WAVSource <corefilters/avisource>` Opens a WAV file or the audio of an AVI file.

.. _Color conversion and adjustment filters:

Color conversion and adjustment filters
---------------------------------------

These filters can be used to change the color format or adjust the colors of
a clip.

- :doc:`ColorYUV <corefilters/coloryuv>` Adjusts colors and luma independently.

  ConvertToYUY2 / ConvertToY8 / ConvertToYV411 / ConvertToYV12 / ConvertToYV16 /
  ConvertToYV24 <corefilters/convert>` AviSynth can deal internally with the
  color formats, RGB24, RGB32, YUY2, Y8, YV411, YV12, YV16 and YV24. These filters
  convert between them.

  color channel from each of the input videoclips.
- :doc:`Merge / MergeChroma / MergeLuma <corefilters/merge>` This filter makes it possible to merge
  luma, chroma or both from a videoclip into another. There is an optional
  weighting, so a percentage between the two clips can be specified.

Overlay and Mask filters
------------------------

These filters can be used to layer clips with or without using masks and to
create masks.

.. _Pixel restoration filters:

Pixel restoration filters
-------------------------

These filters can be used for image detail (pixel) restoration (like
denoising, sharpening) of a clip.

- :doc:`Blur / Sharpen <corefilters/blur>` These are simple 3x3-kernel blurring and sharpening

  chroma channels incorrectly, and I added a FixBrokenChromaUpsampling filter
  to compensate for it.

.. _Timeline editing filters:

Timeline editing filters
------------------------

These filters can be used to arrange frames in time (clip cutting, splicing
and other editing).

- :doc:`AlignedSplice / UnalignedSplice <corefilters/splice>` AlignedSplice and UnalignedSplice join two
  or more video clips end to end.

  through last-frame.

.. _Interlace filters:

Interlace filters
-----------------

These filters can be used for creating and processing field-based material
(which is frame-based material separated into fields). AviSynth is capable of
dealing with both progressive and interlaced material. The main problem is,
that it often doesn't know what it receives from source filters. This is the
reason that the field-based flag exists and can be used when dealing with
interlaced material. More information about field-based video can be found
:doc:`here <advancedtopics/interlaced_fieldbased>`.

- :doc:`AssumeFrameBased / AssumeFieldBased <corefilters/parity>` Forces frame-based or field-based
  material.

  produces double the number of frames by combining both the odd and even pairs
  of fields.
- :doc:`PeculiarBlend <corefilters/peculiar>` This filter blends each frame with the following frame in a
  peculiar way.
- :doc:`Pulldown <corefilters/pulldown>` The Pulldown filter simply selects two out of every five frames
  of the source video.
- :doc:`SeparateColumns / SeparateRows <corefilters/separatefields>` Takes a clip and separates the columns or
  rows of each frame into new frames.
- :doc:`SeparateFields <corefilters/separatefields>` SeparateFields takes a frame-based clip and splits each
  frame into its component top and bottom fields.

  clip and combines them together to produce interlaced frames.
- :doc:`WeaveColumns / WeaveRows <corefilters/weave>` Takes a clip and weaves sets of columns or rows
  together to produce a composite frames.

.. _Audio processing filters:

Audio processing filters
------------------------

These filters can be used to process audio. Audio samples from a clip will be
automatically converted if any filters requires a special type of sample.
This means that if a filter doesn't support the type of sample it is given,
it will automatically convert the samples to something it supports. The
internal formats supported in each filter is listed in the sample type
column. A specific sample type can be forced by using the :doc:`ConvertAudio <corefilters/convertaudio>`
functions.

If the sample type is float, when AviSynth has to output the data, it will be
converted to 16 bit, since float cannot be passed as valid AVI data.

- :doc:`Amplify / AmplifydB <corefilters/amplify>` Amplify multiply audio samples by amount.
- :doc:`AssumeSampleRate <corefilters/assumerate>` Adjusts the playback speed of the audio.
- :doc:`AudioDub / AudioDubEx <corefilters/audiodub>` AudioDub takes the video stream from the first
  argument and the audio stream from the second argument and combines them.
  AudioDubEx is similar, but it doesn't throw an exception if both clips don't
  have a video or audio stream.
- :doc:`AudioTrim <corefilters/trim>` Trims an audio clip so that it includes only the start_time
  through end_time.
- :doc:`ConvertToMono <corefilters/converttomono>` Merges all audio channels.
- :doc:`ConvertAudioTo8bit / ConvertAudioTo16bit / ConvertAudioTo24bit / ConvertAudioTo32bit /
  ConvertAudioToFloat <corefilters/convertaudio>` Converts audio samples to 8, 16,
  24, 32 bits or float.

.. _Meta filters:

Meta filters
------------

These special filters can be used to control other filters execution.

- :doc:`Animate / ApplyRange <corefilters/animate>` Animate (ApplyRange) is a meta-filter which evaluates
  its parameter filter with continuously varying (the same) arguments.
- :doc:`TCPDeliver <corefilters/tcpdeliver>` This filter will enable you to send clips over your network.
  You can connect several clients to the same machine.

.. _Conditional filters:

Conditional filters
-------------------

The basic characteristic of conditional filters is that 'their scripts' are
evaluated (executed) at every frame instead of the whole clip. This allows
for complex video processing that would be difficult or impossible to be
performed by a normal AviSynth script.

- :doc:`ConditionalFilter / FrameEvaluate / ScriptClip / ConditionalSelect <corefilters/conditionalfilter>`
  ConditionalFilter returns source1 if some condition is met, otherwise it
  returns source2. ScriptClip/FrameEvaluate returns the clip which is returned
  by the function evaluated on every frame. ConditionalSelect returns one frame
  from several sources based on an integer evaluator.
- :doc:`ConditionalReader <corefilters/conditionalreader>` ConditionalReader allows you to import information from
  a text file, with different values for each frame - or a range of frames.
- :doc:`WriteFile / WriteFileIf / WriteFileStart / WriteFileEnd <corefilters/write>` These filters
  evaluate expressions and output the results to a text-file.

.. _Debug filters:

  frame indicating what number Avisynth thinks it is.
  ShowSMPTE displays the SMPTE timecode. **hh:mm:ss:ff**
  ShowTime displays the duration with millisecond resolution. **hh:mm:ss.sss**
- :doc:`StackHorizontal / StackVertical <corefilters/stack>` StackHorizontal takes two or more video
  clips and displays them together in left-to-right order.
