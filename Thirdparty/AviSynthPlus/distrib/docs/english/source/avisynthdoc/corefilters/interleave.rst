Interleave
==========

``Interleave`` (clip1, clip2 [, ...])

``Interleave`` interleaves frames from several clips on a frame-by-frame
basis, so for example if you give three arguments, the first three frames of
the output video are the first frames of the three source clips, the next
three frames are the second frames of the source clips, and so on.

Also see :ref:`here <multiclip>` for the resulting clip properties.
