FreezeFrame
===========

``FreezeFrame`` (clip, int first_frame, int last_frame, int source_frame)

The ``FreezeFrame`` filter replaces all the frames between first_frame and
last_frame with a copy of source_frame. The sound track is not modified. This
is useful for covering up glitches in a video in cases where you have a
similar glitch-free frame available.
