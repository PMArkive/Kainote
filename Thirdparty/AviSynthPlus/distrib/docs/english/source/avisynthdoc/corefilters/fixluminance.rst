FixLuminance
============

``FixLuminance`` (clip, int intercept, int slope)

My VCR has the annoying habit of making the top of each frame brighter than
the bottom. The purpose of this filter is to progressively darken the top of
the image to compensate for this. If you've noticed a similar problem with
your VCR, email me and I'll finish this explanation of how the filter works.
Otherwise, you can pretend it doesn't exist.

This filter works only with YUY2 input.
