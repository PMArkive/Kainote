SelectEven / SelectOdd
======================

| ``SelectEven`` (clip)

``SelectEven`` makes an output video stream using only the even-numbered
frames from the input. ``SelectOdd`` is its odd counterpart.

Since frames are numbered starting from zero, ``SelectEven`` actually selects
the first, third, fifth,... frames by human counting conventions.
