This folder is a placeholder for installer prerequisites, which has to be updated before creating the installer
Such as Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable packages for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022: VC_redist.x64.exe and VC_redist.x86.exe 

Installer searches for XP redistributables under specific names: 
VC_redist_14.27.29114.0.x86.exe and VC_redist_14.27.29114.0.x64.exe
When you download these, rename VC_redist.x86.exe and VC_redist.x64.exe if XP specific builds are set in installer script

Important note:
  Windows XP Support: Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on April 8, 2014
  As of 2021, XP-specific AviSynth builds still require a _compatible_ (=not latest) Visual C++ runtime.

  Runtime library support for Windows XP is no longer available in the latest Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022.
  The last redistributable to support Windows XP is version 16.7 (file version 14.27.29114.0*).
  If Windows XP apps are deployed with or updated to a later version of the redistributable, the apps won't run.

  As discussed in issue: https://github.com/AviSynth/AviSynthPlus/issues/241

  *Others experienced that the latest XP compatible version is 14.28.29213.0.
